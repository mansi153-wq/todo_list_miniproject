üìù To-Do List in C

Console-based To-Do List application with user authentication and per-user task storage.

üîπ Description

This is a C console application for managing personal tasks.
Users can sign up and log in.
User credentials are stored securely in users.txt.
Passwords are hidden while typing using masked input (*).
Each user has a separate CSV file to store their tasks.
Tasks can be added, edited, deleted, or marked as done, with priority levels and optional due dates.
Users can also view task statistics.

üîπ Features

üîπ How it Works
User signs up or logs in.
Usernames and passwords are saved in users.txt.
Tasks are stored in a per-user CSV file.
Users interact with a console menu to manage tasks.
All changes are saved automatically to the CSV file.

üîπ Usage
Compile:
gcc todo.c -o todo
Run:
./todo

üîπ Notes
Works on Windows console (uses _getch() for password masking).
Each user has a separate CSV file, allowing multiple users to use the program independently.

Technologies & Concepts Used
C Programming: Functions, loops, conditionals, and console I/O
Data Structures: Structs and dynamic arrays (TaskList)
File Handling: Reading/writing CSV files and storing user credentials
String Manipulation: strcpy, strcmp, strlen, strcspn
Algorithms / Logic: CRUD operations, task search, statistics calculation
Other Techniques: Boolean logic (stdbool.h), password masking (_getch()), input validation
Passwords are hidden while entering for security.
